## 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art object detection model, trained on **MRI brain scan datasets** to accurately identify tumour regions.

### 🔍 The model provides:
- 📦 **Bounding boxes** around tumour regions  
- 🎯 **Confidence scores** for predictions  
- 🧠 **Visual overlays** highlighting detected tumours  

A lightweight **Streamlit interface** enables users to upload MRI images and instantly view detection results.

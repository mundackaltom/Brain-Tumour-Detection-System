# 🧠 Brain Tumour Detection System using YOLOv8

A deep learning project that detects brain tumours from MRI scans using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.  
Includes a Streamlit web app for uploading MRI images and viewing the detection results in real time.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project uses **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art object detection model, trained on MRI brain scan datasets to identify tumour regions.

The model outputs:
- Tumour bounding boxes  
- Tumour confidence scores  
- Visualization of predicted regions  

A simple **Streamlit-based interface** allows users to upload MRI images and get predictions instantly.
